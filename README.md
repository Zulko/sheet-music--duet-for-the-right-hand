# Duet for the right hand alone

This little piece of music ([PDF available here](https://github.com/Zulko/sheet-music--duet-for-the-right-hand/raw/master/duet-for-the-right-hand-alone.pdf)) is encoded as a LilyPond file, ``duet-for-the-right-hand-alone.ly``. To compile it into a beautiful PDF file, you must have Lilypond installed (and even better, use an editor like Frescobaldi). It is published under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 3.0) license.

Enjoy !
